Code for my Cambridge Part III Essay, about Deep Reinforcement Learning.

### Questions & To-do list
1. Multilayer Perceptron as estimator for the Q value function.
  - How to choose the number of layers?
  - How to choose the number of features?
  - How to calculate the gradient?

2. Coding POO-style.
  - Think about the code architecture.
  - Try to find good examples of Q-Learning implementation
  
First goal : get a first draft of functional code, which would be improved "iteratively".

### Code examples 
An implementation of DQN using OpenAI gym, tensorflow w/ multilayer perceptron :

### 7.02 Update

Code for q_network and cartpole implementation. Problem : the system is apparently not learning.

### 8.02 Update

Problem solved. Need to assess it directly with gym tools.
